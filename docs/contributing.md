## Development Workflow

- Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b my-feature
  ```
- Make your changes and commit with clear messages.
- Run tests, lint, and type checks locally before pushing:
  ```bash
  hatch run lint
  hatch run type
  hatch run test
  ```
- If you update docs, check them locally:
  ```bash
  hatch run docs:serve
  # Visit http://localhost:8000
  ```
- Push your branch and open a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub.
- Ensure all CI checks pass and respond to review feedback.

---

## Code Style & Quality
- Code must pass **Ruff** (PEP8 + best practices):
  ```bash
  hatch run lint
  ```
- Type annotations are required and checked with **mypy**:
  ```bash
  hatch run type
  ```
- All new code should include tests (pytest) and docstrings.
- Use pre-commit to auto-format and catch issues before commit.

---

## Documentation
- User and API docs are in `docs/` (Markdown, MkDocs).
- To build and preview docs locally:
  ```bash
  hatch run docs:serve
  ```
- For API docs, use Google-style docstrings.

---

## Tests
- All tests are in the `tests/` directory.
- Run the full suite with:
  ```bash
  hatch run test
  ```
- Coverage and security checks are available via Hatch tasks.

---

## Community & Support
- Please be respectful and follow our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).
- Open issues for bugs, questions, or feature requests.
- Join discussions on GitHub for ideas and feedback.
