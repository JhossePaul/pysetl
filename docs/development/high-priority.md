## Parallel Execution of Factories Within Stages

**Status:** Investigation Required
**Module:** `src/pysetl/workflow/stage.py`

**Current Behavior:**
- All factories within a stage execute sequentially
- Stages execute sequentially within the pipeline

**Desired Enhancement:**
- Allow parallel execution of independent factories within the same stage
- Maintain dependency resolution and data flow integrity

**Technical Challenges:**

- [ ] Investigate Python threading capabilities with PySpark
- [ ] Research PySpark's thread safety and session management
- [ ] Understand SparkSession behavior across multiple threads
- [ ] Evaluate performance implications of parallel vs sequential execution

**Investigation Areas:**

1. **Python Threading:**
   - ThreadPoolExecutor for factory execution
   - AsyncIO for I/O-bound operations
   - Multiprocessing for CPU-bound operations

2. **PySpark Considerations:**
   - SparkSession thread safety
   - DataFrame operations across threads
   - Memory and resource management
   - Job scheduling and resource allocation

3. **Dependency Management:**
   - Ensuring factories with dependencies wait for their inputs
   - Managing shared resources and state
   - Error handling and rollback mechanisms

**Potential Implementation Approaches:**

1. **Thread-based parallelism:** Use ThreadPoolExecutor for independent factories
2. **Async execution:** Implement async/await pattern for I/O operations
3. **Process-based parallelism:** Use multiprocessing for CPU-intensive operations
4. **Hybrid approach:** Combine different parallelism strategies based on factory type

## Pipeline Optimizers

**Status:** Planning
**Module:** `src/pysetl/workflow/optimizer/`

**Current Issue:**
- No automatic optimization of pipeline execution
- Suboptimal resource utilization and performance
- Manual optimization requires deep expertise

**Vision:**
Create an intelligent pipeline optimization system that analyzes DAGs and automatically applies performance improvements, going beyond the basic dependency optimization in the [SETL SimplePipelineOptimizer](https://github.com/SETL-Framework/setl/blob/master/src/main/scala/io/github/setl/workflow/SimplePipelineOptimizer.scala).

**Enhancements Needed:**

- [ ] Dependency analysis and deduplication
- [ ] Execution path optimization
- [ ] Resource utilization optimization
- [ ] Cost-based optimization strategies
- [ ] Performance prediction and monitoring
- [ ] Automatic optimization recommendations

**Implementation Approaches:**

1. **Dependency Analysis & Deduplication:**
   - Detect identical data transformations across factories
   - Merge redundant operations
   - Create shared intermediate results
   - Identify common subgraphs

2. **Execution Path Optimization:**
   - Reorder stages for better resource utilization
   - Parallel execution of independent branches
   - Smart caching of expensive computations
   - Dynamic execution plan adjustment

3. **Resource Optimization:**
   - Memory usage optimization
   - Spark partition optimization
   - Connection pooling and reuse
   - Resource allocation strategies

4. **Cost-Based Optimization:**
   - Estimate execution costs for different strategies
