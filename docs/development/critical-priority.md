# Critical Priority

*Items that are blocking production readiness or causing significant issues.*

## Error Handling and Recovery

**Status:** Planning
**Module:** `src/pysetl/workflow/`

**Current Issue:**
- Limited error recovery mechanisms - if a factory fails, the entire pipeline stops
- Poor fault tolerance for production environments
- No retry mechanisms or graceful degradation

**Enhancements Needed:**

- [ ] Comprehensive error handling across all modules
- [ ] Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- [ ] Graceful degradation strategies
- [ ] Error reporting and logging improvements
- [ ] Partial pipeline execution capabilities
- [ ] Circuit breaker patterns for external dependencies

**Investigation Areas:**

1. **Retry Strategies:**
   - Exponential backoff for transient failures
   - Configurable retry counts and timeouts
   - Different retry policies for different failure types

2. **Graceful Degradation:**
   - Skip failed factories when possible
   - Provide fallback data sources
   - Maintain pipeline integrity with partial failures

3. **Error Classification:**
   - Distinguish between transient and permanent failures
   - Categorize errors by severity and impact
   - Implement appropriate handling strategies

**Implementation Approaches:**

1. **Factory-Level Error Handling:**
   - Wrap factory execution in try-catch blocks
   - Implement retry logic for transient failures
   - Provide fallback mechanisms for critical failures

2. **Pipeline-Level Error Handling:**
   - Continue execution with failed factories skipped
   - Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies
   - Provide detailed error reporting and logging

3. **User Experience:**
   - Clear error messages and recovery suggestions
   - Partial results when possible
   - Comprehensive error reporting and monitoring

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Pipeline continues execution even with factory failures
- [ ] Automatic retry for transient failures
- [ ] Clear error reporting and logging
- [ ] Graceful degradation for non-critical failures
- [ ] Production-ready error handling patterns
