## clearJobGroup Functionality

**Status:** Investigation Required
**Module:** `src/pysetl/workflow/stage.py`

**Current Issue:**

- The `run_factory` method sets job groups for Spark monitoring but cannot clear them

## Pandera Integration for Enhanced Data Validation

**Status:** Planning
**Module:** `src/pysetl/validation/`

**Current Issue:**

- Limited data validation capabilities beyond basic type checking with TypedSpark
- No comprehensive validation for data quality, business rules, or cross-engine compatibility
- Missing advanced features like schema inference, error reporting, and API integration

**Vision:**

Integrate [Pandera](https://pandera.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as a
comprehensive data validation framework to replace and enhance the current
TypedSpark-based validation, providing production-ready data quality assurance
across multiple DataFrame engines.

### **Why Pandera Integration is Critical:**

#### **Current Limitations:**

- **TypedSpark**: Basic type safety only, limited to Spark DataFrames
- **No Business Rule Validation**: Cannot validate ranges, patterns, or custom logic
- **Single Engine**: Limited to Spark ecosystem
- **Poor Error Reporting**: Basic type errors without detailed context
- **No Schema Evolution**: Cannot handle schema changes or versioning

#### **Pandera's Capabilities:**

- ✅ **Multi-Engine Support**: pandas, polars, pyspark, modin, dask, geopandas
- ✅ **Rich Validation**: Range checks, regex patterns, custom functions, hypothesis testing
- ✅ **Schema Inference**: Automatic schema generation from existing data
- ✅ **Schema Persistence**: Save and version schemas for reproducibility
- ✅ **Lazy Validation**: Aggregate errors for comprehensive reporting
- ✅ **FastAPI Integration**: Perfect for web service validation
- ✅ **Data Synthesis**: Generate test data for validation scenarios
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Battle-tested in enterprise environments

### **Proposed Integration Architecture:**

#### **Core Components:**

```python
from pysetl.validation import PanderaValidator, ValidationConfig
import pandera as pa

# Define comprehensive schemas
class CitizenSchema(pa.DataFrameModel):
    name: pa.Field[str] = pa.Field(str_length=pa.Check.greater_than(0))
    age: pa.Field[int] = pa.Field(ge=0, le=150)
    city: pa.Field[str] = pa.Field(str_length=pa.Check.greater_than(0))
    email: pa.Field[str] = pa.Field(regex=r'^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+$')

# Enhanced Factory with Pandera validation
class CitizensFactory(Factory[DataSet[Citizen]]):
    def __init__(self):
        self.validator = PanderaValidator(CitizenSchema)
        self.validation_config = ValidationConfig(
            lazy=True,  # Aggregate errors
            drop_invalid_rows=False,  # Fail fast
            error_report_format="detailed"
        )

    def read(self):
        self.citizens = create_partially_filled_dataset(spark, Citizen, [...])
        # Validate with comprehensive Pandera checks
        validation_result = self.validator.validate(
            self.citizens,
            config=self.validation_config
        )
        if not validation_result.is_valid:
