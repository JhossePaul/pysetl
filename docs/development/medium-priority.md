## clearJobGroup Functionality

**Status:** Investigation Required
**Module:** `src/pysetl/workflow/stage.py`

**Current Issue:**
- The `run_factory` method sets job groups for Spark monitoring but cannot clear them
- Comment in code: `# TODO: Find a way to clearJobGroup since sparkContext method doesn't exist`

**Investigation Needed:**

- [ ] Check PySpark 3.1+ API for `clearJobGroup` method availability
- [ ] Investigate alternative approaches for job group management
- [ ] Test with different PySpark versions to determine compatibility
- [ ] Research if this is a Python-specific limitation or general PySpark issue

**References:**
- [PySpark SparkContext API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.SparkContext.clearJobGroup.html)
- [SPARK-22340](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22340) - Job group assignment issues

**Potential Solutions:**

1. Use `clearJobGroup()` if available in current PySpark version
2. Implement custom job group management
3. Use alternative Spark monitoring approaches
4. Document limitation and provide workarounds
