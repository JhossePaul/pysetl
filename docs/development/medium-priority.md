## Legacy Code Migration Tool

**Status:** Planning
**Module:** `src/pysetl/migration/` or companion package

**Current Issue:**
- No automated way to migrate existing Python/PySpark code to PySetl
- Manual migration is time-consuming and error-prone
- High barrier to adoption for teams with existing codebases

**Vision:**
Create an intelligent migration tool that analyzes Python scripts, notebooks, or
modules using AST parsing and automatically generates equivalent PySetl code.
This would significantly lower the adoption barrier and help teams migrate
legacy ETL processes.

**Enhancements Needed:**

- [ ] AST-based code analysis and pattern recognition
- [ ] ETL pattern detection and extraction
- [ ] Automatic PySetl code generation
- [ ] Interactive migration wizard
- [ ] Validation and testing of generated code
- [ ] Rollback and comparison capabilities

**Implementation Approaches:**

1. **AST Analysis & Pattern Recognition:**
    - Parse Python scripts/notebooks using `ast` module
    - Identify ETL patterns (read → transform → write)
    - Detect data dependencies and transformations
    - Recognize common data processing patterns
    - Map Python operations to PySetl concepts

2. **Code Generation:**
    - Generate PySetl Factory classes
    - Create appropriate Delivery declarations
    - Build Stage and Pipeline structures
    - Preserve business logic and transformations
    - Generate documentation and comments

3. **Intelligent Refactoring:**
    - Suggest optimal factory boundaries
    - Identify reusable components
    - Optimize data flow patterns
    - Recommend performance improvements
    - Handle complex dependencies

4. **Migration Support:**
    - Interactive migration wizard
    - Validation of generated code
    - Rollback capabilities
    - Side-by-side comparison tools
    - Migration progress tracking

**Technical Investigation Areas:**

- [ ] Python AST module capabilities and limitations
- [ ] Pattern recognition algorithms for ETL code
- [ ] Code generation strategies and templates
- [ ] Integration with Jupyter notebooks
- [ ] Testing and validation frameworks
- [ ] User interface design for migration tools

**Potential Use Cases:**

1. **Script Migration:** Convert standalone Python ETL scripts
2. **Notebook Migration:** Transform Jupyter notebooks with ETL logic
3. **Module Migration:** Refactor existing Python modules
3. **Incremental Migration:** Migrate parts of large codebases
5. **Learning Tool:** Help users understand PySetl patterns

**Success Metrics:**

- [ ] Migration accuracy and completeness
- [ ] Performance preservation or improvement
