Factory module for PySetl.

    """
    Core abstraction for ETL logic in PySetl.

    A Factory encapsulates a unit of ETL business logic, abstracting the process into
    three main steps: read, process, and write. Users subclass Factory to implement
    their own data transformations, and then compose these factories into stages and
    pipelines. This approach encourages a modular, maintainable, and reusable project
    structure, especially valuable for large ETL processes.

    Factories declare their dependencies using Delivery instances as class attributes.
    At runtime, the pipeline and dispatcher resolve these dependencies, inject the
    required data, and orchestrate the execution of each factory.

    The get method is used by the pipeline to extract the output of the factory and
    register it as a Deliverable in the dispatcher registry, making it available to
    downstream consumers.

    To use PySetl, users subclass Factory, implement the abstract methods, and pass
    their factories to stages and pipelines. This results in a tidy, testable, and
    scalable ETL codebase.

    Attributes:
        consumers (set[type[Factory]]): Set of factories that consume this factory's output.
